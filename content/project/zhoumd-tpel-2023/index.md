- A novel current estimator is proposed for CRM control. The behaviors of the estimator considering the nonlinear output capacitance of switching devices are modeled and analyzed;
- No current sensor, ZCD circuit, or ZVS-catch circuits are required. This reduces the component count of the peripheral circuits and the resistive losses in the power circuit;
- To improve the prediction performance, a disturbance damping control is proposed to mitigate the variation of inductance and parasitic resistance.
- The proposed current estimator provides information on both the instant current and average current. The noisy CRM current signal is excluded from the control loop;
- High power factor and high efficiency can be realized simultaneously. Valley-switching and zero-voltage switching are achieved;
- The proposed concept is naturally compatible with high-frequency GaN devices.
